# Purpose: Calculate the cost based on the input of width, length, and floor type
# Determine user package type Name: calculate_room_cost
# Parameters:  width, length, flooring_type
# Algorithm: 
# 1) Based on the input of the floor type set the correct cost corresponding to the floor type
# 2) calculate the area room by multiplying the width and length
# 3) multiply the area by the cost of the floor type 
# 4) return the cost
#
# Purpose: check if the input of width or length is 
# Determine user package type Name: check_float
# Parameters: val
# Algorithm: 
# 1) check if the input value is a real number
# 2) if the input value is above 0 
#    a) return value
# 3) Otherwise return -999 
#
# Purpose: main 
# Determine user package type Name: main
# Parameters: none
# Algorithm:
# 1) create variables for a loop and total price and set them to 0
# 2) when x is less than 5
#    A) room number is one greater than x
#    B) Prompt the user to input the width of the room
#    C) When the width is not a decimal or whole number and is below 0
#       a) Prompt the user to input a valid input for the width 
#    D) Prompt the user to input the length of the room
#    E) When the length is not a decimal or whole number and is below 0
#       a) Prompt the user to input a valid input for the length
#    F) Prompt the user to input a floor type
#    G) Calculate the pricing of the area based on floor type
#    H) Output the price for the room
#    I) Add the price of the room to the total cost  
#    J) add 1 to x
#  3) Output the total price of the house
