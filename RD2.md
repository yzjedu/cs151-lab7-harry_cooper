	In this lab I learned alot of stuff including how to properly use functions in my code and how to write them out in my algorithm. 
Working with my partner was alright while I wrote the code and algorithm, he helped with the test cases and debuggig with the code. 
The hardest part of this lab is that writing the algorithm for the functions was very confusing until i got the hang of it. 
After i wrote the algorithm, writing the code was very simple because everything was planned out. Then, I started to plug in some of 
the values until I entered in a string for width and length which caused my code to crashed or produce an error. This gave me a hard time 
so I created another function just to check if the user input is a float, number or string. Lasty, we ran all our test in the test cases to see if there was any 
errors left that we might have missed. Overall the Lab was fairly understandable and working with my partner was very simple.
